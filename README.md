of that song to win a Grammy for any category.


## Data Source
We'll be preforming our analysis, and answering our questions using this [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danield2255/data-on-songs-from-billboard-19992019)
from Kaggle. Specifically the Spotify Top 200 Weekly dataset, and the Grammy Songs dataset.
